	- Implicit multiplication is not supported
	- Decimals are not supported
	- The minus sign works as either a binary operator or unary operator with very high precedence
	- Prefix increment operator is not currently supported
	- Checking for negative numbers and zeroes being in unfortunate positions is not checked in this part of the code.
	- Bitwise AND as well as bitwise OR are not supported.
	- Multi-character tokens, such as milti-digit numbers, &&, ||, >=, <=, etc will be split up by spaces.
